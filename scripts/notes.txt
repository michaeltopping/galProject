- Ways of detecting lines -
# nope #take derivative spectrum, smooth it, then search for lines -- Probably won't work
# no #apply some sort of filtering
# no #find jumps in cumulative spectrum


- Questions -
What does it mean when a detection is contaminated?
How rare is a protocluster like this at z=3?
To measure the escape fraction, wouldn't you need to know something about the galaxies, like
  how much LyC they are emitting in the first place?
Does the escape fraction change with redshift?
What causes the offsets in NB vs. R images?


- TODO -
Want to create a file browsing system to allow selecting from multiple places
# done #Calculate redshifts from absorption
	fit each absorption line separately and average the redshifts
	cross correlate a list of absorption lines near a guess redshift
	# did not work/unnecessary # Monte Carlo subtract noise, then cross correlate with metal lines
# done # Check if the continuum is equal on both sides of the LyA line
# done # Make sure you're checking the correct aperture
Check for double peaked behavior
# done # Add fit to a continuum
# done # Make sure emission fitting is not fitting absorption lines
# done # Also fit absorption lines
# done # For duplicate objects, fit both and average redshifts?
# done # Make guesses for other two datasets.
